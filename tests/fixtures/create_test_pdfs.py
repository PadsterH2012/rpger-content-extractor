CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS

Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination.

ABILITY SCORES
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

Strength, measuring physical power
Dexterity, measuring agility
Constitution, measuring endurance
Intelligence, measuring reasoning ability
Wisdom, measuring awareness
Charisma, measuring force of personality

ARMOR CLASS
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle.""",

by J.R.R. Tolkien

Chapter 1: An Unexpected Party

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors.""",

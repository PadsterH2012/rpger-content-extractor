DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
Player's Handbook
5th Edition

CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS

Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination.

ABILITY SCORES
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

Strength, measuring physical power
Dexterity, measuring agility
Constitution, measuring endurance
Intelligence, measuring reasoning ability
Wisdom, measuring awareness
Charisma, measuring force of personality

ARMOR CLASS
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle.
